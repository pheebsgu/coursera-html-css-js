  		<h2>BLINDING LIGHTS</h1>
  	    <p>I've been tryin' to call<br>
  	       I've been on my own for long enough<br>
           Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe<br>
           I'm going through withdrawals<br>
           You don't even have to do too much<br>
           You can turn me on with just a touch, baby<br>
           I look around and<br>
           Sin City's cold and empty (oh)<br>
           No one's around to judge me (oh)<br>
           I can't see clearly when you're gone.<br>
           ...</p>

  	    <h2>DANCE MONKEY</h1>
  	    <p>They say oh my god I see the way you shine<br>
           Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine<br>
           You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by<br>
           And now I beg to see you dance just one more time<br>
           Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time<br>
           And oh my I, I, I like your style<br>
           You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry<br>
           And now I beg to see you dance just one more time</p>

  	    <h2>ROSES</h1>
  	    <p>Roses, I walked in the corner with the body screaming dolo<br>
           Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo<br>
           This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo<br>
           You already know though, you already know though<br>
           I walk in the corner with the money, on my finger<br>
           She might get it popping, I might wife her for the winter<br>
           I already know, already know, nigga roses<br>
           All I need is roses</p>
